            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>OSEHRA's community is composed over 2000 members across the globe, representing a diverse range of occupations and skillsets.  This community maintains VistA and its related technologies by contributing though leadership, expertise, coding support, and testing services.</p>
            <p>To participate in the OSEHRA community, register for an account at <A HREF="http://www.osehra.org" target="_blank" alt="OSEHRA">www.osehra.org</A>.  Once registered, you can post thoughts and ideas to the discussion boards.  OSEHRA assists the community by establishing workgroups for topics of interest, and providing resources such as conference lines, webinars, and as required development tools such as issue trackers and repositories.  You may review the complete list of workgroups <A HREF="http://osehra.org/groups" target="_blank" alt="OSEHRA Groups">here</A>.</p>
            <p>OSEHRA supports a number of corporate members and participating organizations which have expertise in VistA.  They provide services such as consulting, hosting, integration, training and support for OSEHRA VistA.  Additionally, many offer products and extensions which help the product serve a number of medical and operational needs across the community.  More information can be found below.
            <p>Additionally, many of the developers of VistA participate in the "Hardhats" community.  While not managed by OSEHRA, it contains a wealth of VistA knowledge and conversations, and can be accessed <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/Hardhats" target="_blank" alt="Hardhats">here</A>.</p>
            <p>The community maintains the vast majority of documentation for VistA.  For new community members, this site is meant to be a curated environment which helps them navigate the VistA ecosystem.  This site is maintained on Github by OSEHRA, and uses Github pages to render it's presentation by referencing the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.<p>If you have suggestions for this site, please contribute them to the "Product Site" campaign on <A HREF="osehra.ideascale.com" alt="Ideascale" target="_blank">Ideascale</A>.</p><p>If you have revisions you would like added to this site, please issue a <A HREF="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests" target="_blank" alt="Pull Request Instructions">pull request</A> using <A HREF="https://github.com/OSEHRA/VistA-Site" target="_blank" alt="Github Repository">Github</A>.</p>

            <h1>Developer Community</h1>
            <p>VistA is developed and maintained by an open source community.  Of particular note however is our largest contributor, the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Having acted as the principal developer for VistA for over 30 years, it provided initial funding to establish OSEHRA with the aim of coordinating its future development of this technology with the greater VistA community.</p>
            <p>Being a government agency, and one which handles the HIPAA protected healthcare records of million of U.S. Veterans, VA has an extensive software development process known as ProPath which is designed to ensure software meets a high bar of safety prior to implementation.  Given this, in order to facilitate the ease with which VA can adopt, share, and collaborate on development, OSEHRA has collaborated with VA to establish a methodology through which code contributions are reviewed for safety, standards compliance, and functionality.  OSEHRA's core development processes, and iterative certification activities, are designed to be as minimally intrusive as possible in order to encourage development, while still providing a reasonable sense of assurance that contributions are not dangerous, poorly documented, or incompatible.</p>
            <p class="lead">Planning & Issue Tracking</p>
            <p>While community participants each may have their own development priorities based on interests or organizational needs, OSEHRA VistA provides several tools to capture development activities.  These include:</p>
            <p><i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i> <A HREF="http://osehra.ideascale.com/" target="_blank" alt="Ideascale">Ideascale</A> - Ideascale provides a forum for community members to propose and up-vote ideas for product enhancement under the "OSEHRA VistA" campaign.</p>
            <p><i class="icon-check"></i> <A HREF="http://issues.osehra.org/browse/VISTA" target="_blank" alt="JIRA">Issue Tracker</A> - A JIRA instance is freely available to the community for issue tracking and agile development support.</p>
            <p class="lead">Development and Testing</p>
            <p>For contributions to be accepted to OSEHRA VistA, they must pass attestation as "Safe, Compliant, and Functional."  More information on this process can be found <A HREF="http://osehra.org/page/software-quality-certification/" target="_blank" alt="Certification Documents">here</A>.  In practical terms, this means when development on a feature is at a point where it can be contributed to OSEHRA VistA, it must go through a Gerrit Code Review.  To learn more about Gerrit, click <A HREF="http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.6/index.html" target="_blank" alt="Gerrit Information">here</A>.
            <p><i class="icon-random"></i> <A HREF="http://code.osehra.org/gitweb" target="_blank" alt="Git">Git Repositories</A> - Contributions to OSEHRA VistA must be committed to OSEHRA's Git repositories.  To acheive this, they are submitted to Gerrit for review, which automatically commits the code upon acceptance.  For more information on how to submit for code review, click <A HREF="http://www.osehra.org/page/contributor-git-instructions" target="_blank" alt="Gerrit Instructions">here</A>.</p>
            <p><i class="icon-ok"></i> <A HREF="http://review.code.osehra.org/" target="_blank" alt="Gerrit">Gerrit Review System</A> - Code contributions made to OSEHRA must under go code review.  Depending on the nature of the contribution, varying levels of documentation may be requested.  For more information on what type of documentation may be asked for, click <A HREF="http://www.osehra.org/wiki/submitting-gerrit-code-review-system" target="_blank" alt="Code Review Details">here</A>.</p>
            <p><i class="icon-th-list"></i> <A HREF="http://code.osehra.org/CDash/index.php?project=Open+Source+EHR" target="_blank" alt="Dashboard">Testing Dashboard</A> - If you are developing against the OSEHRA development Virtual Machine, or have followed the instructions for establishing a testing machine located on the <A HREF="../resources/index.html" alt="Resources">Resources</A> page, your machine will automatically run nightly tests for code quality.  These can be invaluable for understanding the impact of modifications.  OSEHRA iteratively enhances this testing suite by incorporating tests from accepted contributions.</p>
            <p class="lead">Documentation and Licensing</p>
            <p>For code to be accepted it must meet certain bars of documentation quality.  Often this means enhancing existing documentation.  All existing documentation is available under the <A HREF="../resources/index.html" alt="Resources">Resources</A> page.  Additionally, OSEHRA offers the following to support development:</p>
            <p><i class="icon-leaf"></i> <A HREF="http://www.osehra.org/wiki/how-apply-apache-20-license-your-software-project" target="_blank" alt="Apache 2.0 Guidance">Apache 2.0 Guidance</A> - All contributions to be included as a component of OSEHRA VistA must be licensed as <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html" target="_blank" alt="Apache Terms">Apache Version 2.0</A>.  OSEHRA offers guidance on applying this license.</p>
            <p><i class="icon-file"></i> <A HREF="http://wiki.osehra.org" target="_blank" alt="Git">Confluence Wiki</A> - Documentation is preferably supplied in editable formats for ongoing updates.  OSEHRA provides a wiki so community members may collectively store and update documentation.</p>

            <h1>Supporting Organizations</h1>
            <p>OSEHRA's community consists of member organizations who support and use VistA in a large variety of ways.  Many of our members have built businesses around providing installation, integration, and support for VistA in medical settings.  Others use it as a source for analytics, an educational tool, or any number of applications enabled by its open nature.  As members in good standing of the OSEHRA community, these partners regularly contribute time and effort to maintaining the OSEHRA VistA platform.  This includes activities such as maintaining compatability with it's patch stream, contributing enhancements which are universally adoptable, and crafting the product's roadmap.</p>
            <p class="lead">VistA Supporters</p>
            <p>These members are active community participants which provide a variety of OSEHRA VistA capabilities such as integration, hosting, analytics, and extensions.</p>
