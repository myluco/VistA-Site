              <h1>Getting Started</h1>
            <p>VistA has been in development by the Department of Veterans Affairs for over 30 years, and has generations of knowledge integrated into its codebase.  If you are a medical professional, it can take a while to fully understand all of the features VistA has, and how to use them in a clinical setting.  If you are a technologist, grasping how VistA operates can feel intimidating.  Hopefully, these resources can help guide you on your mission to understand VistA.</p>
            <p>This site acts as an structured way to organize the various resources in the community, and constitutes an ever evolving directory of information.  As you run across resources, we encourage you to contribute to this body of knowledge.  In the spirit of the open-source efforts to maintain and grow VistA, this site is licensed under Apache 2.0 and maintained using Github.  Feedback or comments are greatly appreciated using ideascale, or more directly, Github pull requests for updates to this body of knowledge are highly encouraged.</p>
<!--What is OSEHRA VistA? -->
            <p class="lead">What is OSEHRA VistA?</p>
            <p>OSEHRA VistA is a community supported, open-source Electronic Health Record capable of being adapted and implemented by the healthcare industry.  It maintains bi-directional compatibility with the Department of Veterans Affairs implementation of VistA, as well as the community at large, so enhancements may be shared and integrated universally.</p>
            <p>Prior to the creation of OSEHRA VistA, VA would create code, and contribute it to the community after redacting a few sensitive or proprietary components.  This code was not inherently functional, so the companies which took the code had to make changes to allow it to run.  They would also modify it to fix problems, and extend it to offer new features.
            </p><p>
            Over the years, this created several major issues.  VA was never be able to integrate solutions made by the community into its version of VistA, so they never received the benefit of those enhancements, and the community had to constantly review and change patches VA released for their system to function.  Furthermore, there was little collaboration between private organizations, meaning each group had its own fix for every problem.  These "forked" code bases meant a lot of duplicate work, and sporadic collaboration.</p>
            <p>To combat these issues, VA funded the creation of the organization now known as "OSEHRA."  OSEHRA helps VA better share development with the outside community, and collaborate among industry partners.  To foster this collaboration, OSEHRA needs a code base that is supportable by both VA and the industry as a whole.  That code base is OSEHRA VistA.</p>
            <p>By starting with a clean, "FOIA" version of VistA, and using it as a conduit through which code changes occur, OSEHRA gives VA the ability to create or adopt enhancements in the open, and internalize those enhancements into its enterprise version.  Furthermore, as the community converges onto this standard, everyone may share development costs by working on the same VistA, while still maintaining the extensions they use to differentiate themselves to the market.
            </p><p>By iteratively certifying this code base as "Safe, Compliant, and Functional," OSEHRA gives the developer community a reasonable level of assurance that the code does what it is supposed to.  From there, integrators may take these communal enhancements and more easily share them with their customers.</p>
            <p>OSEHRA VistA is a minimally functional version of VistA.  It is constituted of the universally accepted components of VistA, and acts as a platform for extension and enhancement.  It comes without warranty, and will require some expertise to get up and running.</p>
            <p>For development or educational purposes, the code base available here acts as an excellent introduction to VistA.  If you are considering implementing OSEHRA VistA in a medical environment, this is an great place to start understanding VistA's capabilities. If implementing, OSEHRA highly recommends working with our supporting organizations to assist in the modification, implementation and support of the software.</p>

            <h1>System Architecture</h1>
            <p>VistA can conceptually be viewed as a platform, capable of being modified and extended to meet the requirements of each installation.  This "platform" is largely constituted of M/MUMPS code, as well as several extensions, such as a CPRS, a clinician-facing Graphical User Interface.</p>
            <p>VistA has historically been comprised of "packages," wherein each package represents a feature or development initiative.  While the code is categorized this way, VistA is a tightly integrated system, and many of these packages inherently rely on functionality in several adjoining packages.  As such, it is considered a best practice never to "remove" packages from an installation, but rather to disable and/or simply not use the package.  This approach means the code available for download at this location is a superset of functionality.</p>
            <p>While many of our partner organizations contribute to the maintenance of the platform code, they have also developed a number of complimentary open-source projects which can meet needs not available in the platform.  For the details on what needs those projects serve, please visit the <A HREF="#dl5">Related Projects</A> section.</p>
            <p>VistA is designed to serve a hospital system, which historically has been the Department of Veterans Affairs.  As such, it provides functionality uncommon in many EHR systems, such as Police and Security Management and Library Services.  These funtions are grouped into the following:</p>
            <p><strong>Health Provider Systems</strong> - Supports providers in the care of patients.</p>
            <p><strong>Registration, Enrollment, and Eligibility Systems</strong> - Supports administrators in patient management.</p>
            <p><strong>Health Data Systems</strong> - Supports standardized terminologies and repository/registry integrations.</p>
            <p><strong>Management and Financial Systems</strong> - Supports non-medical hospital management activities.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Services</strong> - Supports enterprise deployments requiring multi-site integrations.</p>

              <h1>User Training</h1>
            <p>Whether in a medical or educational setting, training is typically required to enable staff to properly use and administer VistA.  This can either be self-administered through the use of available resources, or performed by hands-on guidance by VistA experts.  For hands on training, many of our corporate partners are willing to provide educational support for VistA; this may be a particularly attractive option for highly customized implementations.  For self-administered education, the listing below constitute the majority of the resources available to the community.</p>
