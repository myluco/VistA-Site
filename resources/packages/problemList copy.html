<p>A Problem List is used to document and track a patient’s problems. It provides the clinician with a 
current and historical view of the patient’s health care problems across clinical specialties, and allows 
each identified problem to be traceable through the VistA system in terms of treatment, test results, 
and outcome.</p>
<p>This application supports primary care givers, such as physicians, nurses, social workers, and others, in 
inpatient and outpatient settings. It is also designed to be used by medical and coding clerks. A variety of 
different data entry methods are possible with this application.</p>
<p>Use of Problem List varies from site to site, depending on the data entry method a facility has chosen. 
Many sites use Encounter Forms, with clerks entering most of the data in the encounter forms. Encounter 
Forms are generated from patient data in the system and added to or modified by clinicians.</p>
